<h3>Quantifying GST/HST & QST paid on employees' expenses per year</h3>
<p>You may want to assess how much tax your organization is paying on employees' expenses. Is your organization exposed to a meaningful tax 
risk on employees' expenses?  Below is a simulation of an organization that has reimbursed to its employees supplies where 10% were incurred 
outside Canada. As for the supplies incurred in Canada, 90% are taxable supplies, other than zero rated supplies within the following 4 provinces.</p>


<h3>GST, HST & QST paid by an organization on employees expenses per year</h3>

<table class="table table-alternative table-hover">

<p>So in this example for each $1,000,000 of employees' expenses, there is approximately $100K of taxes to manage.</p>

<p>Generally, for a large business that is a GST and a QST registrant and exclusively engaged in commercial activities these taxes are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Fully recoverable (i.e. office supplies)</li>
<li>Partially recoverable (i.e. 50% or 80% on some meals)</li>
<li>Not recoverable (i.e. tax on insurance premium)</li>
<li>Remittable (i.e. RITC on specified property ad services in Ontario & Prince Edward Island)</li>
<li>QST partly recoverable on expenses covered by the restricted ITR such as KM allowance, from January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2018 to December 31, 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>For this QST gradual elimination of the restricted input tax refund, at the rate of 25% In 2018, 50% in 2019, 75% in 2020 and 100% thereafter, 
this tax policy represents a major spending for the Government of Quebec. Within the 2017-2018 budget of the government of Quebec, it is indicated 
that this measure will cost $22 million for the financial year 2017-2018, $115 million for the financial year 2018-2019, $220 million for the 
financial year 2019-2020 and $336 million for the financial year 2020-2021.</p>

<p>The QST recovery by large businesses due to the phasing out of restricted input tax credits on expenses such as meal & entertainment, km allowance, 
gas for vehicles of less than 3000 kg, vehicles of less than 3000 kg, telecommunication and energy is substantial. Advataxes is an employee 
expense software designed notably to recover QST on the phasing out of restricted ITR on reimbursement of expenses and allowances paid to employees.</p>
