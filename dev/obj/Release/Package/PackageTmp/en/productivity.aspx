			<h3 class="margin-top-10">Does your Employee Expense System have the right GST/HST/QST Responsibility Allocation Method?</h3>
			<p>An easy way to boost productivity within your organization when it comes to employee expenses is to use an efficient employee expense software.</p>
<p>A major task of an employee expense software for expenses incurred in Canada is to manage significant net recoverable GST, HST and QST, see our <a href="https://www.advataxes.ca/en/simulation.aspx">simulation page</a> on this topic.</p>
<p>If this task is not properly done, opportunities may be lost, tax assessments including penalties and interest may result.</p>
<p>You may incur unplanned consultants fees and unplanned time spent on these audits will remove your employees from working on productive tasks.</p>

              <p>They do not store information in a central database which impairs efficiencies, management and creates Accounts Payable integration issues with manual posting.</p>

              <h3>Complex tax rules</h3>
              <p>As the complexities of tax rules increase, so does the list of tax codes employees are expected to select from. Since employee expenses are filled out by most employees in an organization, not just accountants, there can be errors in selecting the proper tax codes, which end up in tax assessments and missed opportunities.</p>

              <h3>Employees are not accountants</h3>
              <p>A direct posting to tax accounts by all employees encounters the same issues as the above; an expectation that non-accountants understand and manage complex tax rules which leads to numerous errors.</p>

              <span class="fa fa-arrows"></span>
<p>Advataxes was designed to reorganize the tax responsibility allocation as per recent additional tax complexities such as: 5 different tax zones in Canada, Recapture of Input Tax Credits</span> in Ontario and Prince Edward Island, ITC and the abolition of the 5% QST factor.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="fa fa-cloud-upload"></span>
<p>You will also be able to upload a digital copy of your invoice, as this is the proper document requested by tax authorities, whether you use the factor method or the exact method.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

            <li>
              <span class="fa fa-file-text-o"></span>
<p>When filling out an expense (excluding expenses related to airfare), your employees will simply select the transaction date, the jurisdiction and the expense type, which will trigger the tax rule based on your organization's profile.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
