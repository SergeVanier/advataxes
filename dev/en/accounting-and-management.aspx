	<span class="fa fa-link"></span>
	<p>Depending on the structure of your organization, our software enables you to link your expenses to a work order, a project or a cost centre. If there are several companies in your corporate group, you may assign expenses incurred, taxes to claim and remit to each company. This will allow you to easily upload the periodic posting in your Accounts Payable.</p>

	<span class="fa fa-dollar"></span>
	<p>The foreign currency conversion of the US dollar, the Euro, the British Pound, the Mexican Peso, the Japanese Yen, the Renminbi, the Hong Kong dollar and the Indian Rupee are done automatically in Canadian dollars and updated several times a week.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<span class="fa fa-database"></span>
	<p>Your data to be imported will include expense amounts, input tax credits (ITC), input tax refunds (ITR) and the temporary recapture of input tax credits (RITC). The detailed posting of expenses may be done both in terms of the employee reimbursements and in terms of credit card payment.</p>
